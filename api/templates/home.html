    <p>Tasket (Task Basket) automates property-specific tasks that many property managament products do not account for. By completing work automatically, office staff can use their time where it really matters: making their complex the best place to live. 
    <p>To get started, visit the <i>Tasks</i> dropdown. If you have any tasks that can benefit from automation, speak with the website author, and they will develop an update as soon as possible!</p>

    <p>Coming soon:</p>
